cdfBinomial
==============================================

Purpose
----------------

Computes the binomial cumulative distribution function.

Format
----------------
.. function:: cdfBinomial(successes,trials,prob)

    :param successes: Nx1 vector or scalar. successes must be a positive number and < trials
    :type successes: NxK matrix

    :param trials: ExE conformable with successes. trials must be > successes.
    :type trials: TODO

    :param prob: The probability of success on any given trial. ExE conformable with  successes. 0 < prob < 1.
    :type prob: TODO

    :returns: p (*NxK matrix*), Nx1 vector or scalar.

Examples
----------------
What are the chances that a baseball player with a long-term batting average of .317 could break Ichiro Suzuki's record of 270 hits in a season if he had as many at bats as Ichiro had that year, 704?

::

    // The cumulative probability of our player 
    //getting 270 or fewer hits in the season  
    p = cdfBinomial(270,704,.317); 
    p = 0.9999199430052614

Therefore the odds of this player breaking Ichiro's record:

::

    1-p = 0.0000000000037863 or 0.0000000003786305%

Â 

:math:`\mathit{\mathrm{\mathtt{P\left( x\, \leq k \right)}} =}\mathit{\sum\limits_{i = 0}^{k}\begin{pmatrix}
n \\
i \\
\end{pmatrix}\, p^{i}\left( 1 - p \right)^{n - i}}`
For invalid inputs, cdfBinomial will return a scalar error code which,
when its value is assessed by function scalerr, corresponds to the
invalid input. If the first input is out of range, scalerr will return a
1; if the second is out of range, scalerr will return a 2; etc.
