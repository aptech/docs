Installation
============

Constrained Optimization MT 2.0 requires GAUSS 16 or later. In GAUSS 16+ there is an
**Applications Installation Wizard** available to install your application.

From within GAUSS go to **Tools -> Install Applications** and follow the prompts to install
GAUSS Applications from the downloaded .zip file.

For GAUSS 20 and later, the `GAUSS Package Manager <https://www.aptech.com/blog/gauss-package-manager-basics/>`_ should be used for installation. 

Difference Between the Linux/Mac and Windows Versions
