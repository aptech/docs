Discrete Choice (DC)
============================
Provides an adaptable, efficient, and user-friendly environment for linear data classification.

Description
----------------
Discrete Choice Analysis Tools 2.1 provides an adaptable, efficient, and user-friendly environment for linear data classification. It's designed with a full suite of tools built to accommodate individual model specificity, including adjustable parameter bounds, linear or nonlinear constraints, default or user-specified starting values, and user specified Gradient and Hessian procedures. Newly incorporated data and parameter input procedures make model set-up and implementation intuitive.
