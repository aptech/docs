cls
==============================================

Purpose
----------------

Clears the program input/output window.

Format
----------------
.. function:: cls

Remarks
-------

This command clears the window and locates the cursor at the upper left
hand corner of the window. It is sometimes useful to put a :func:`cls` statement
at the beginning of a program that prints a report to the screen so that
you have fewer lines of data to look at.

.. seealso:: `locate`
