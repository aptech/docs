BHATLIB Library 
=======================
 The GAUSS BHATLIB provides pre-built support for the flexible estimation of multinomial probit, multivariate ordered-response, and multiple discrete-continuous
models. It also provides a fulle suites of efficient matrix operations and gradient-enabled routines for multivariate distribution evaluation, including Bhatâ€™s (2018) analytic approximation to the multivariate normal cumulative distribution function. These additional tools, in conjunction with GAUSS optimization libraries, support the estimation of a wide range of advanced econometric models.

The library is designed to be flexible and efficient, allowing users to easily estimate complex models with large datasets. It includes a variety of procedures for model estimation, diagnostics, and forecasting, making it a powerful tool for econometric analysis.

Installation
--------------

Modeling Procedures
------------------------------
The BHATLIB library provides a wide range of procedures for estimating various econometric models. Below is a summary of the key procedures available in the library:
========================== =====================================================================================================================
:func:`linearmdecvfit`       Estimates parameters for the Multiple Discrete-Continuous Extreme Value (MDCEV) model using linear utility for the outside good. Supports input data and specification strings for consumption quantities and explanatory variables.
:func:`mnpfit`           Estimates the Multinomial Probit (MNP) model using analytic gradients and a variety of analytic approximation methods for the multivariate cumulative normal distribution, supporting mixture-of-normals random coefficients and flexible covariance restrictions.
:func:`morpfit`            Estimates a multivariate ordered response probit (MORP) model using flexible correlation structures and efficient maximum likelihood estimation.
:func:`morpATEFit`         Estimates a multivariate ordered response probit (MORP) model with average treatment effects (ATE) using flexible correlation structures and efficient maximum likelihood estimation.`
