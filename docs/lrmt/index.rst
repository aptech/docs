Linear Regression MT
============================
Set of procedures for estimating single equations or a simultaneous system of equations in GAUSS.

Description
----------------
The **Linear Regression MT** application module is a set of procedures for estimating single equations or a simultaneous system of equations. It allows constraints on coefficients, calculates het-con standard errors, and includes two-stage least squares, three-stage least squares, and seemingly unrelated regression. It is thread-safe and takes advantage of structures found in later versions of **GAUSS**. 

Installation
--------------
If you're interested in purchasing **LRMT** Please `contact us <https://www.aptech.com/contact-us>`_ to request pricing and installation information.

If you already own **LRMT** , you can use the `GAUSS Package Manager <https://www.aptech.com/blog/gauss-package-manager-basics/>`_ for quick download and installation.

Requires GAUSS/GAUSS Engine/GAUSS Light v8.0 or higher.

Key Features
------------------------------

Provides convenient and comprehensive tools for linear regression including:

* Heteroskedastic-consistent standard errors.   
* Performs both influence and collinearity diagnostics inside the ordinary least squares routine (OLS).  
* All regression procedures can be run at a specified data range.  
* Performs multiple linear hypothesis testing with any form.  
* Estimates regressions with linear restrictions.  
* Accommodates large data sets with multiple variables.  
* Stores all important test statistics and estimated coefficients in an efficient manner.  

Thorough Documentation
++++++++++++++++++++++++
The comprehensive user's guide includes both a well-written tutorial and an informative reference section. Additional topics are included to enrich the usage of the procedures. These include:

* Joint confidence region for beta estimates.  
* Tests for heteroskedasticity.  
* Tests of structural change.  
* Using ordinary least squares to estimate a translog cost function.  
* Using seemingly unrelated regression to estimate a system of cost share equations.  
* Using three-stage least squares to estimate Klein's Model I.
