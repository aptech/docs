pdSummary
==============================================

Purpose
----------------
Generates summary statistics for panel data, including overall, between-group, and within-group statistics.

Format
----------------
.. function:: pdOut = pdSummary(x, groupvar [, varlist, missings])

    :param x: A matrix of panel data with N rows (observations) and K columns (variables).
    :type x: NxK matrix

    :param groupvar: A column vector indicating group membership for panel observations.
    :type groupvar: Nx1 matrix

    :param varlist: Optional, A list of variables to include in the summary. Default is all variables.
    :type varlist: 1xP matrix

    :param missings: Optional, scalar, indicator that missings are present in data. Missing values must be 
    removed for procedure. Setting to 0 will speed up procedure but should be used only if certain that no missings are present. Default = 1.

    :type missings: Scalar

    :return pdOut: A dataframe containing summary statistics:
        
        - Overall statistics: mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum for each variable.
        - Between-group statistics: mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum.
        - Within-group statistics: mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum.
        - Additional information: number of groups, average number of observations per group (T_ave), balance indicator (_isbalanced), valid and missing observation counts.

    :rtype pdOut: Data frame

Examples
----------------

::

    // Panel data matrix (4 observations, 3 variables)
    x = { 1 10 100,
          2 20 200,
          3 30 300,
          4 40 400 };
    
    // Group variable (indicating group membership for each observation)
    groupvar = {1, 1, 2, 2};

    // Summarize all variables, dropping missing values
    pdOut = pdSummary(x, groupvar);

The code above will return a data frame with overall, between-group, and within-group summary statistics.

Remarks
-------

The summary statistics generated by :func:`pdSummary` include between and within-group variations that are useful for panel data analysis. If the `varlist` argument is provided, the summary is restricted to those variables. Missing data can be handled by setting the `drop_missings` argument to 1.

The returned data frame contains:

- "Variable" and "Measure" columns for the name of the variable and the type of statistic (Overall, Between, Within).
- The statistics include mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values.
