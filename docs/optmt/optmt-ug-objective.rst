The Objective Function
======================

The procedure **OPTMT** finds values for the parameters in such that :math:`F(\theta)` is minimized. **OPTMT** has been designed to make the specification of the function and the handling of the data convenient. The user supplies a procedure that computes :math:`F`` given the parameters in :math:`theta`.
