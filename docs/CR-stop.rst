stop
==============================================

Purpose
----------------

Stops a program and returns to the command prompt.
 Does not close files.

Format
----------------
.. function:: stop



Remarks
-------

This command has the same effect as end, except it does not close files
or the auxiliary output.

It is not necessary to put a stop or an end statement at the end of a
program. If neither is found, an implicit stop is executed.
