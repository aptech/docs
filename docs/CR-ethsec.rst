ethsec
==============================================

Purpose
----------------

Computes the difference between two times, as generated by
the date command, in hundredths of a second.

Format
----------------
.. function:: ethsec(tstart, tend)

    :param tstart: starting date, in the order:
        yr, mo, day, hundredths of a second.
    :type tstart: 4x1 vector

    :param tend: ending date, in the order:
        yr, mo, day, hundredths of a second.
        MUST be later date than  tstart.
    :type tend: 4x1 vector

    :returns: hs (*scalar*), elapsed time measured in hundredths of
        a second.

Remarks
-------

This will work correctly across leap years and centuries. The
assumptions are a Gregorian calendar with leap years on the years evenly
divisible by 4 and not evenly divisible by 100, unless divisible by 400.


Examples
----------------

::

    let date1 = 2008 1 2 0;
    let date2 = 2009 9 14 0;
    t = ethsec(date1,date2);

After the code above, t is equal to:
