rowcontains
==============================================

Purpose
----------------

   Checks whether any element in the row of a matrix or string array matches any element from a separate symbol.

Format
----------------
.. function:: rowcontains(haystack,  needles)

    :param haystack: multi-dimensional array or string array in which to search.
    :type haystack: matrix

    :param needles: the elements to search for in haystack.
    :type needles: vector or string array

    :returns: mask (*vector*), with the same number of rows as
        the input haystack, containing only 1's and 0's. Each element
        of the output, mask, will contain a 1 if any element in
        the corresponding row of haystack matches any element in needles.

Examples
----------------

//A string array with categorical variables
string catvars = { "married" "unemployed"      "king",
                    "single" "unemployed" "snohomish",
                    "single"   "employed"      "king",
                   "married"   "employed"      "king",
                    "single"   "employed"    "pierce" }; 

criteria = "single" $| "unemployed";

//Find any observations in which the participant
//is either single or unemployed 
mask = rowcontains(catvars, criteria);

After the above code, mask will equal:

::

    1
    1
    1
    0
    1

data = { 26 121 4,
        999 139 2,
         45 145 2,
         51   . 3 };

//Search for 999 or a GAUSS missing value '.'
bad_vals = 999 | miss(0,0);

//Search 'names' for instances of any of 
//the strings in 'missing' 
mask = rowcontains(data, bad_vals);
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

After the code above, mask will equal:

::

    0
    1
    0
    1

Remarks
+++++++

rowcontains is similar to the dot operators '.==' and '.$=='. The
differences are that rowcontains allows for the comparison of more than
one needle in each element of the haystack and rowcontains reports one
value for each row in haystack, rather than one value for each element
in haystack.

To return a mask of ones and zeros the same size as haystack, use
ismiss.
