rndKMi
==============================================

Purpose
----------------

Returns a matrix of random integers, 0 â‰¤ y < 232, and the 
state of the random number generator.

Format
----------------
.. function:: rndKMi(r, c, state)

    :param r: row dimension.
    :type r: scalar

    :param c: column dimension.
    :type c: scalar

    :param state: 
        Scalar case:state = starting seed value. If -1, GAUSS
        computes the starting seed based on the system clock.
        
        500x1 vector case:state = the state vector returned from a previous
        call to one of the rndKM random number generators.
    :type state: scalar or 500x1 vector

    :returns: y (*TODO*), r x c matrix of random
        integers between 0 and 232 - 1, inclusive.

    :returns: newstate (*500x1 vector*), the updated state.

Remarks
-------

r and c will be truncated to integers if necessary.


Examples
----------------
This example generates two thousand vectors of random integers, 
each with one million elements. The state of the random number 
generator after each iteration is used as an input to the next 
generation of random numbers.

::

    state = 13;
    n = 2000;
    k = 1000000;
    c = 0;
    min = 2^32+1;
    max = -1;
     
    do while c < n;
       { y,state } = rndKMi(k,1,state);
       min = minc(min | minc(y));
       max = maxc(max | maxc(y));
       c = c + k;
    endo;
     
    print "min " min;
    print "max " max;

Technical Notes
+++++++++++++++

rndKMi generates random integers using a KISS+Monster algorithm
developed by George Marsaglia. KISS initializes the sequence used in the
recur-with-carry Monster random number generator. For more information
