FANPAC MT
============================
Contains procedures for the analysis of categorical data using loglinear analysis.

Description
----------------
The **Financial Analysis Application MT** (**FANPAC MT**) provides econometric tools commonly implemented for estimation and analysis of financial data. **FANPAC MT** allows users to tailor each session to their specific modeling needs and is designed for estimating parameters of univariate and multivariate Generalized Autoregressive Conditionally Heteroskedastic (GARCH) models.

Installation
--------------
If you're interested in purchasing **FANPAC MT** Please `contact us <https://www.aptech.com/contact-us>`_ to request pricing and installation information.

If you already own **FANPAC MT** , you can use the `GAUSS Package Manager <https://www.aptech.com/blog/gauss-package-manager-basics/>`_ for quick download and installation.

Requires GAUSS/GAUSS Engine/GAUSS Light v10 or higher
