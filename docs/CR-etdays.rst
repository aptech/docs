etdays
==============================================

Purpose
----------------

Computes the difference between two times, as generated by the date command, in days.

Format
----------------
.. function:: etdays(tstart, tend)

    :param tstart: starting date, in the order:
        yr, mo, day. (Only the first 3 elements are used.)
    :type tstart: 3x1 or 4x1 vector

    :param tend: ending date, in the order:
        yr, mo, day. (Only the first 3 elements are used.)
        MUST be later than  tstart.
    :type tend: 3x1 or 4x1 vector

    :returns: days (*scalar*), elapsed time measured in days.

Remarks
-------

This will work correctly across leap years and centuries. The
assumptions are a Gregorian calendar with leap years on the years evenly
divisible by 4 and not evenly divisible by 100, unless divisible by 400.


Examples
----------------

::

    let date1 = 2008 1 2;
    let date2 = 2009 9 14;
    d = etdays(date1,date2);

After the code above, d is equal to:
