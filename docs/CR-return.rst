return
==============================================

Purpose
----------------
Returns from a subroutine.

Format
----------------
.. function:: return 
			  return(x, y,...)



Remarks
-------

The number of items that may be returned from a subroutine in a return
statement is limited only by stack space. The items may be expressions.
Items are separated by commas.

It is legal to return with no arguments and therefore return nothing.
